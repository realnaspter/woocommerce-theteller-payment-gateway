= Reason for creating this plugin: =
E-commerce is fast-becoming the convenient go-to in sales strategy for most sellers. Reason being cost-saving, wide reach and relative ease of management of clients and staff. Ghana, a developing nation has caught on to this recent rave. In doing this, Ghanaian e-commerce owners have also realized the ease, convenience and efficiency of using such a strategy with many choosing WordPress WooCommerce as their preferred E-Commerce system. However, the only inhibiting factor is the absence of a payment facilitation tool to complete the online buying experience. 

The advent of a free online payment tool developed by PaySwitch (Theteller) has made it possible for the wish of many e-commerce owners to be realized. We have therefore created this plug-in to enable the full integration of this payment tool with many e-commerce websites developed from WordPress with woocommerce.
